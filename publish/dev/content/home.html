<h1>Home</h1>
<p>Welcome to the home page. It's probably not the first page you're seeing, because there is a lot of
    config and setup documentation as well.</p>
<p>This content is loaded from a separate file. You can edit this file to customize the home page content.</p>
<img src="images/gaztank_home.webp" alt="GAZ Tank Home Image" width="600" height="400"/>
<p>No doubt you love this Home image, right ;)</p>
<p>Well, updating the image in the src/images directory and then updating the HTML to point to 
the new image is all you need to do if you want to see a better one.</p>
