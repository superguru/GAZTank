# Package Module Configuration
# ============================
# Configuration for the website packager module
#
# This file defines which files and directories should be excluded
# from the packaging process when copying from src/ to publish/{env}/
#
# Usage:
#   python -m package -e dev
#   scripts\package.cmd -e staging
#   scripts\package.sh -e prod

[package]
# Maximum number of backup packages to retain per environment
max_backups = 4

[exclusions]
# Directories to exclude from packaging (relative to src/ directory)
# These are source files that should not be copied to the environment
directories = [
    "components",       # HTML source components (composition sources)
    "includes",         # HTML and Markdown includes (not standalone)
    "pages",            # Page templates (composition sources)
]

# File patterns to exclude (glob patterns)
# Add specific file patterns that should never be packaged
files = [
    "*.psd",          # Photoshop files
    "*.ai",           # Adobe Illustrator files
    "*.sketch",       # Sketch files
    "*.fig",          # Figma files
    "*.xcf",          # GIMP files
    "*.pdn",          # Paint.NET files
    ".DS_Store",      # macOS metadata
    "Thumbs.db",      # Windows thumbnails
    "desktop.ini",    # Windows folder settings
]

# Notes:
# - Directory names are matched at any level in the src/ tree
# - File patterns use glob syntax (* = any characters, ? = single character)
# - Paths are case-sensitive on Linux/Mac, case-insensitive on Windows
