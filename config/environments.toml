# Build Pipeline Configuration
# ============================
# Defines environments for development, staging, and production builds.
#
# Each environment has:
# - dir: Directory name under publish/ where build artifacts are stored
# - httpd_port: Default port for the development server
# - ftpd_port: Default port for the FTP simulation server
# - description: Human-readable description of the environment
#
# Usage:
#   scripts\server.cmd -e dev           # Uses httpd_port 7190, serves from publish/dev/
#   scripts\server.cmd -e staging       # Uses httpd_port 7191, serves from publish/staging/
#   scripts\server.cmd -e prod -p 7190  # Override httpd_port to 7190, serves from publish/prod/
#   scripts\gzhost.cmd -e dev           # Uses ftpd_port 2190, FTP server on publish/dev/
