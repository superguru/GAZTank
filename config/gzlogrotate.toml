# GZLogging - Log Rotation Configuration
#
# Global defaults for log file management. These values apply to all tools
# but can be overridden per-tool in tools.toml by specifying the same
# attributes with different values.
#
# All log files are stored in .\logs with rotated logs in .\logs\00rotated

[rotation]
# compress: Compress old log files when rotating (true/false)
#   true  = rotated files are compressed to .zip format
#   false = rotated files remain as .log format
compress = true

# rotation_count: Maximum number of rotated log files to keep per tool
#   When the count is exceeded, the oldest rotated files are deleted
#   Only rotated files in .\logs\00rotated are counted
#   The active (current day) log file is NOT included in this count
#   Both .log and .zip files are counted (setting can change over time)
rotation_count = 5

# Note: Rotation happens automatically when a new log file is created
# (typically once per day). The rotation logic is hidden from module users.
