# FTP Users Configuration
# ========================
# Defines FTP user credentials and permissions for each environment.
# Used by gzhost module to simulate remote FTP deployment targets.
#
# Each environment has:
# - username: FTP login username
# - password: FTP login password (plain text, local development only)
# - permissions: Permission string for pyftpdlib authorizer (e.g., "elradfmwMT")
#
# Permission Characters (pyftpdlib):
#   e = change directory (CWD, CDUP)
#   l = list files (LIST, NLST, STAT, MLSD, MLST, SIZE)
#   r = retrieve file from server (RETR)
#   a = append data to existing file (APPE)
#   d = delete file or directory (DELE, RMD)
#   f = rename file or directory (RNFR, RNTO)
#   m = create directory (MKD)
#   w = store file to server (STOR, STOU)
#   M = change file mode/permissions (SITE CHMOD)
#   T = change file modification time (SITE MFMT)
#
# Common Permission Sets:
#   "elr"        = Read-only access
#   "elradfmwMT" = Full access (read, write, delete, create)
#   "elrw"       = Read and write, no delete
#
# Usage:
#   scripts\gzhost.cmd -e dev      # FTP server with dev user credentials
#   scripts\gzhost.cmd -e staging  # FTP server with staging user credentials

[environments.dev]
username = "devup"
password = "devup"
permissions = "elradfmwMT"

[environments.staging]
username = "staging_user"
password = "staging_pass"
permissions = "elradfmwMT"

[environments.prod]
