# Tools Configuration
# ===================
# Configuration for development and deployment tools.
#
# Each environment has:
# - log_dir: Directory path relative to logs/ where tool logs are stored
# - description: Human-readable description of the environment
#
# Note: Environment sections must match those in environments.toml
#
# Tool-Specific Log Rotation Overrides:
# Individual tools can override global rotation settings from gzlogrotate.toml
# by adding a [tools.toolname] section with these optional attributes:
# - compress: true/false (override global compress setting)
# - rotation_count: number (override global rotation_count setting)
#
# Example:
# [tools.server]
# compress = false
# rotation_count = 60
